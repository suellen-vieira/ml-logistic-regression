# Customer Churn Prediction

This project analyzes customer data from a telecom company to understand and predict customer churn, that is, which customers are likely to cancel their service.


## Objectives

- Identify key features that influence customer churn
- Build a predictive model using Logistic Regression
- Help the company reduce churn through actionable insights

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview

- **Customer demographics** (age, partner, dependents)
- **Service details** (internet type, phone, streaming)
- **Contract type** (month-to-month, one year, two year)
- **Billing and payment** (monthly charges, paperless billing, payment method)
- **Churn status** (Yes or No)

## ðŸ§ª Model Used

- **Logistic Regression** with:
  - L1 and L2 regularization
  - `class_weight='balanced'` to handle class imbalance
- Evaluated using **ROC AUC score** and **confusion matrix**
